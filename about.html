    <p> A little about me.  My name is Shannon Beebe and I am 44 years old. I have two grown daughters whom I am very proud of. Now that they have grown, I am learning to focus on me.</p>
        
    <li>I am have found new hobbies, such as riding my Harley Davidson Iron 883 (she is named Etta)</li> 
    <li>I am now attending a bootcamp for Front End Software Development</li>
    <li> I am also working towards a happier / healthier me with working out.</li><br> I enjoy swimming a few times a week, walking/jogging and most recently have started weight lifting some in order to tone. I love going to the lake and enjoying the peace it brings either on a boat, kayaking with my dogs, or just sitting on the land overlooking the water. </p>
